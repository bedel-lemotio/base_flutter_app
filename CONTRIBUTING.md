## How to contribute to the Base Flutter App

### New features

The Base Flutter App is meant to be a starter application for creating useful applications.

Experience shows that it can take dozens of hours of work to get fundamental features working in new apps.

The Base Flutter App is designed to reduce the time it takes to get started on a serious project.

Therefore, any feature that could be considered common across a large percentage (think >80%) of applications is welcome.

Conversely, if a feature might be considered niche to a specific type of application, this repository might not be the best place to include it.

Features that meet that 80% threshold would be welcome.

If you have any doubts, open an issue.

### Bugs and cleanup

This has been a passion project up to this point. Therefore, there are very likely bugs in the codebase that have not been caught. If you find a bug, please at least open an issue. If you are able to fix the bug, a pull request would be graciously welcomed.

The code is messy in some areas. Currently, efforts are being made to reduce the clutter in the code.

### Maintainers

I would love to work with someone to help maintain this project. If you are interested in making the Base Flutter App better, please reach out!
